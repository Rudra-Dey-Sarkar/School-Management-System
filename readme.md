# Tech Stack Used 
1. Node.js
2. MongoDB Atlas

## Please Note 
Used MongoDB because I'm comfortable wtih the MongoDB and another reason for
not using MySQL is that most of the MySQL live deployment platform requires paid plans and need to enter Credit card details and rest of the platform is not that good.
